# Conventional Commit Examples

A comprehensive collection of commit message examples following the Conventional Commits specification.

## Features (feat)

### Simple Feature Addition

```
feat: add user profile page
```

### Feature with Scope

```
feat(auth): add two-factor authentication
```

### Feature with Body

```
feat(search): add semantic similarity search

Implement AI-based similarity detection between documents
to improve search relevance. Uses vector embeddings with
configurable similarity threshold.
```

### Feature with Issue Reference

```
feat(api): add webhook signature verification

Add HMAC-SHA256 signature verification for all incoming
webhooks from external services.

Closes #456
```

### Breaking Change Feature

```
feat(api)!: redesign authentication flow

BREAKING CHANGE: The authentication endpoint now requires
OAuth 2.0 instead of API keys. All clients must migrate
to the new OAuth flow.

Migration guide: docs/oauth-migration.md
```

## Bug Fixes (fix)

### Simple Bug Fix

```
fix: resolve login redirect loop
```

### Bug Fix with Scope

```
fix(api): handle null response from webhook
```

### Bug Fix with Detailed Explanation

```
fix(auth): resolve concurrent login race condition

Add pessimistic locking to prevent race condition when
multiple login attempts occur simultaneously for the
same user account.

The race condition could cause session data corruption
when two requests tried to update the user's last_login_at
timestamp at the same time.

Fixes #789
```

### Critical Bug Fix

```
fix(security): prevent SQL injection in search

Sanitize user input before constructing SQL queries in
the search functionality. Replaces string interpolation
with parameterized queries.

SECURITY: This fixes a critical SQL injection vulnerability.

Fixes #CVE-2024-12345
```

## Documentation (docs)

### Simple Documentation Update

```
docs: update README with setup instructions
```

### Documentation with Scope

```
docs(api): add webhook endpoint documentation
```

### Comprehensive Documentation

```
docs(contributing): add code review guidelines

Add detailed guidelines for code reviewers covering:
- Security review checklist
- Performance considerations
- Test coverage requirements
- Commit message standards

Related to #234
```

## Refactoring (refactor)

### Simple Refactoring

```
refactor: extract validation logic to service
```

### Refactoring with Scope

```
refactor(models): simplify tenant scoping logic
```

### Large Refactoring

```
refactor(services): migrate to Result pattern

Convert all service objects to return explicit Result
objects instead of raising exceptions for control flow.

This improves error handling consistency and makes
service behavior more predictable.

Affects:
- Users::CreateService
- Projects::CreateService
- Artifacts::ProcessService

No behavior changes - pure refactoring.
```

## Performance (perf)

### Simple Performance Improvement

```
perf: add database index for user lookups
```

### Performance with Details

```
perf(queries): eliminate N+1 queries in artifacts index

Add eager loading for associated records when fetching
artifacts. Reduces database queries from ~500 to 3 for
a typical page load.

Before: 2.3s page load time
After: 0.3s page load time
```

### Database Optimization

```
perf(db): add composite index for tenant queries

Add composite index on (tenant_id, created_at) for the
artifacts table. Improves query performance for tenant
artifact lists by 10x.

CREATE INDEX idx_artifacts_tenant_created
ON artifacts(tenant_id, created_at DESC);
```

## Tests (test)

### Simple Test Addition

```
test: add specs for user authentication
```

### Test with Scope

```
test(integration): add webhook processing tests
```

### Comprehensive Test Suite

```
test(services): add complete coverage for CreateOrderService

Add unit tests covering:
- Successful order creation
- Validation failures
- Payment processing errors
- Inventory reservation edge cases
- Concurrent order handling

Increases coverage from 67% to 95%.
```

## Chores (chore)

### Dependency Update

```
chore(deps): bump rails from 7.1.0 to 7.2.0
```

### Build Configuration

```
chore: update Docker configuration for production
```

### Maintenance Work

```

the CI pipeline. Scans run on every PR and main branch push.
```

## Style (style)

```
style: format code with StandardRB
```

### CSS Updates

```
style(ui): update button spacing and colors

Align button styles with design system:
- Increase padding from 8px to 12px
- Update primary color to brand blue
- Add hover state transitions
```

## Build (build)

### Build System Changes

```
build: configure webpack for code splitting
```

### Docker Configuration

```
build(docker): optimize production image size

Reduce Docker image size from 1.2GB to 400MB by:
- Using multi-stage build
- Removing development dependencies
- Optimizing layer caching
```

## CI (ci)

### CI Configuration

ci: add parallel test execution
```

### GitHub Actions Update

```
ci(actions): add automatic dependency updates

Configure Dependabot to automatically open PRs for:
- Security updates (daily)

This reverts commit a1b2c3d4.
```

### Revert with Explanation

```
revert: revert "perf: add caching layer"

This reverts commit a1b2c3d4.

The caching implementation caused data inconsistency issues
in multi-tenant environments. Reverting until we can implement
tenant-aware cache invalidation.

### Breaking Change with Migration

```
feat(api)!: change webhook payload structure

BREAKING CHANGE: Webhook payloads now nest data under "payload" key.

Before:
{
  "event": "issue.created",
  "issue_id": 123,
  "title": "Bug report"
}

After:
{
  "event": "issue.created",
  "payload": {
    "issue_id": 123,
    "title": "Bug report"
  }
}

Migration steps:
1. Update webhook handlers to access payload.issue_id
2. Deploy new code
3. Update webhook configuration in integrations

See: docs/webhook-migration.md

Closes #234
```

## Real-World Examples

### Multi-Tenant Feature

```
feat(tenants): add custom subdomain support

Allow tenants to configure custom subdomains instead of
using auto-generated slugs. Includes:
- Subdomain validation (DNS-safe characters)
- Uniqueness checking
- Automatic DNS verification
- Admin approval workflow

Closes #789
```

### API Integration

```
feat(integrations): add third-party data synchronization

Sync data from external services via webhooks. Includes
metadata extraction, validation, and transformation.

The sync runs via webhook for real-time updates and has a
daily batch job for catching any missed events.

Closes #456
Related to #400 (sync architecture)
```

### AI Feature

```
feat(ai): add content extraction from documents

Extract structured data from documents using LLM.
Classifies content by category and confidence level.

Extraction results are reviewed by users before being
finalized and stored.

Closes #234
```

### Security Fix

```
fix(auth): prevent session fixation attacks

Reset session ID on successful login to prevent session
fixation attacks. Also adds secure and httponly flags
to session cookies.

SECURITY: This addresses a medium-severity vulnerability
where attackers could hijack user sessions.

Fixes GHSA-2024-001
```

### Database Migration

```
feat(db): add document embeddings for similarity search

Add new document_embeddings table to store vector embeddings
for semantic similarity search. Uses pgvector extension.

Migration includes:
- Creating embeddings table with vector columns
- Adding indexes for efficient vector search
- Backfilling embeddings for existing documents

Run with: bin/rails db:migrate
Backfill with: bin/rails embeddings:backfill

Closes #567
```

### Background Job

```
feat(jobs): add retry logic for webhook processing

Add exponential backoff retry for failed webhook processing.
Retries up to 5 times with delays: 1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s.

After 5 failures, job is moved to dead queue and alerts
are sent to ops team.

Closes #345
```

### UI Component

```
feat(ui): add confidence badge component

Add component for displaying AI confidence scores with
color-coded badges:
- High (>0.8): Green
- Medium (0.5-0.8): Yellow
- Low (<0.5): Red

Component is reusable across AI-powered features.

Closes #678
```

### Test Coverage

```
test(system): add end-to-end workflow test

Add comprehensive system test covering:
1. User creates project
2. Imports external data
3. AI processes and categorizes content
4. User reviews and approves results
5. Generates final report

Ensures the complete workflow functions correctly
from end to end.

Closes #890
```

### Performance Optimization

```
perf(api): optimize webhook processing

Reduce webhook processing time from ~500ms to ~50ms by:
- Moving AI analysis to background jobs
- Batching database updates
- Caching configuration
- Using database transactions efficiently

This prevents webhook timeout issues with external services.

Closes #456
```
